I have built a website where we can use demodpd data (which is in json format) in table format and edit data here. The plus point over regular demodpd table is that this loads at once and doesn't need to scroll for loading data

website link : Dynamic JSON to Editable Table (adityaroshanpatro.github.io)

example of link to add 
https://demodpd.kore.ai/sbaccounts/?customerId=1045304  - for particular user
https://demodpd.kore.ai/sbaccounts                                      - for all data
https://demodpd.kore.ai/sbtransactions/?customerId=1045678 - transaction data
you can add this to this form in the website and the view and edit data there
